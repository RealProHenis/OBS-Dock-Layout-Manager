# OBS Auto Dock Resizer
A plugin for OBS Studio that saves each dock's position and size, to easily switch to depending on desired layout.

## How To Use:
1. After installing the plugin, open OBS Studio.
2. Set all docks to your preferred sizes.
3. Go to 'Tools' -> 'Dock Layout Manager'.
4. Click 'Save Dock Layout', and enter a name for the dock profile.
5. That's it! Your dock profile is saved
   - Optional: If you want a dock layout to automatically apply on OBS startup, select the dock profile, and click 'Set as Default'.

## Why does this plugin exist?
I created this plugin because OBS Studio always resets dock sizes every time I re-open the program, regardless of what I set them to before last closing. This means I have to manually set the size of each dock every time I re-open OBS Studio. Now, I can save dock size presets, and set one as default to automatically be set on OBS startup.

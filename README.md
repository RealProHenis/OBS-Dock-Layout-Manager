# OBS Auto Dock Resizer
A plugin for OBS Studio that resizes dock dimensions to preset values.

### Why does this plugin exist?
I created this plugin because OBS Studio always opens in a windowed state, and I prefer to maximize it on my my second monitor. This means I have to manually set the size of each dock every time I open OBS Studio. I figured it'd be great if I could maximize OBS, press 1 button, and have every dock change to the dimensions I want.

# OBS Auto Dock Resizer
A plugin for OBS Studio that resizes dock dimensions to preset values.

## How To Use:
1. After installing the plugin, open OBS Studio.
2. Set all docks to your preferred sizes.
3. Go to 'Tools' -> 'Dock Layout Manager'.
4. Click 'Save Dock Layout', and enter a name for the dock profile.
5. That's it! Your dock profile is saved
   - Optional: If you want a dock layout to automatically apply on OBS startup, select the dock profile, and click 'Set as Default'.

## Why does this plugin exist?
I created this plugin because OBS Studio always opens in a windowed state, and I prefer to maximize it on my my second monitor. This means I have to manually set the size of each dock every time I open OBS Studio. I figured it'd be great if I could maximize OBS, press 1 button, and have every dock change to the dimensions I want.

# OBS Dock Layout Manager
A plugin for OBS Studio that saves each dock's position and size, to easily switch to depending on desired layout.<br>

*Supports only Windows (for now)* <br>
*Tested & working on OBS 30.2.3*

## How To Use:
1. After installing the plugin, open OBS Studio.
2. Set all docks to your preferred location & size.
3. In the top OBS menu bar, go to 'Tools' -> 'Dock Layout Manager'.
4. Click 'New', and enter a name for the dock layout.
5. That's it! Your dock layout is saved.
   - Optional: If you want a dock layout to automatically apply on OBS startup, select the layout, and click 'Set as Default'.

## Why does this plugin exist?
I created this plugin because OBS Studio resets dock sizes every time I open the program, regardless of what I set them to before last closing. This means I have to manually set the size of each dock every time I re-open OBS Studio. Now, I can save dock layout presets, and set one as default to automatically be applied every time I open OBS.
